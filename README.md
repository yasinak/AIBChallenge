# AIBChallenge

This project has the ambition to show a 5 day weather forecast, in the challenge context ask by AIB.

## Prerequisite
You need to install the last Xcode from Apple Store.

## How install it
After download this project. You don't need to install something else.
This project used cocoapods dependency manager.
But I included the pod repository to simplified the installation.

## How to Use
To open the project, double click to AIBChallenge.xcworkspace file, Xcode will be launch.
After you can run the project and test it on a simulator.

## Artichecture
The artichecture is a classical MVVM architecture.

## If I had more time
For the next, we can offer to the user to change the location, with a textField. And the possibility to see all details of the weather, humidity, pressure, temp_min, temp_max... on a modal view.
For the moment, a refresh is not interesting because the weather information donâ€™t update regularly like stock market information. However, the information is automatically update every 60 seconds.
And we can add more designs features.

Technically, for this project, a documentations of the architecture of the project is missing. Unit Test, UI Test is missing. 

## To Finish
And to be honest, I spent a little more time than 4 hours...
